# Summary

We are now able to:
*   Explain what is meant by "deep representations" of images
*   Mathematically represent forward and back propagation in a deep neural network
*   Build a multi-layer neural network image classifier using Keras
*   Load a saved `Keras` model
*   Use Keras methods to visualize the activation functions in CNNs

In particular, we now know how to interpret the neural network layers that we have visualized. In other words, we can envision the computer vision.

## Loading models and transfer learning

When we visualized intermediate activations, we loaded a `Keras` model. We'll next see how we can use a load a model and use it to help a different, but related problem with *transfer learning*.
